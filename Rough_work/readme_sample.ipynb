    "Chess is widely renowned as one of the most skill intensive games ever invented. Both sides begin the game with identical pieces in an identical position, there are no random elements (aside from assigning the first move), and the movement of those pieces during a game can result in over 121 million possible combinations in just the fist three moves. Because of this, the player with the most skill is likely to win the grand majority of chess games. I have decided to look into the different elements of a chess game to determine if any of them increase or decrease the chance of a player with lower skill defeating a player with greater skill.\n",

    "Discover drivers of upsets in chess games played on Lichess.org\n",
    "Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to classify games as ending in upset or not ending in upset\n",
    "An upset is defined as a lower rated player defeating a higher rated player.\n",
    "This information could be used to further our understanding of which game elements contribute to or detract from a gameâ€™s skill intensity.\n",
    "Initial Thoughts\n",
    "My initial hypothesis is that drivers of upsets will be elements that either grant an outright advantage to one player or increase the likelihood of players making mistakes.\n",

    "Project Plan Guides the reader through the different stages of the pipeline as they relate to your project\n",
    "Data Dictionary Gives a definition for each of the features used in your report and the units they are measured in, if applicable\n",
